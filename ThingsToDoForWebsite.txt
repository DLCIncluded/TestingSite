Things to do for website

implement UUID into database
//added UUID field in Users DB, need to update Register function so it has UUID after mcUsername in sql

UUID check when logging into website, and update database with MC username IF changed

Python(maybe?) to auto update the mc Pic every hour or so and either pull from sql or json

create the actual whitelist function on the site (admin)
